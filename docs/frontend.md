# Frontend conventions

- Path aliases: `@/*` → `frontend/src/*`, `@wailsjs/*` → `frontend/wailsjs/*`. Declared in both
  `vite.config.ts` and `tsconfig.app.json`; changing one requires changing the other.
- **Colour and type live only in `shared/theme/tokens.css`.** Raw values sit on `:root`, are
  overridden under `:root[data-theme='light']`, and are mapped into Tailwind utilities via
  `@theme inline` — the `var()` indirection is what makes runtime theme switching work without a
  rebuild. Do not hardcode hex values in components.
- Row height is shared between the object tree and the result grid via `shared/theme/density.ts`
  (the virtualizers need it as a number).
- `shared/ui/Split.tsx` wraps `react-resizable-panels`, which renamed its entire public surface
  between v3 and v4. Import splitters from that wrapper, never from the library directly. Note its
  `Panel` inner div carries `overflow: auto`, which surfaces small child overflows as scrollbars.
- TypeScript runs with `strict`, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, and `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`.
  The last one means an optional prop must be typed `foo?: T | undefined` to accept an explicit
  `undefined`.
- `frontend/src/bridge` is the only directory permitted to import `frontend/wailsjs/**`, and it is
  where constants shared with Go live — `bridge/rows.ts` mirrors the const block of
  `internal/app/dto.go`. A component should never hardcode a value the backend also knows.
- Control styling is shared through `shared/ui/Field.tsx`: `CONTROL` for a form control in a dialog,
  the exported `TOOLBAR_CONTROL` for the shorter ones in a toolbar strip.

## Zustand selectors

Selectors must return referentially stable values. A selector that builds a new object or array
per call makes React's snapshot comparison always fail and produces an infinite render loop with a
blank screen. Derive such shapes in `useMemo` from primitive slices instead — `buildTree` in
`stores/connections.ts` is the reference example.
